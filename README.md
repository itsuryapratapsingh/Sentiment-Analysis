# Sentiment-Analysis
Building an Adaptive Sentiment Analysis System in Python

The provided Python code implements a basic Online Sentiment Analysis system utilizing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The objective is to demonstrate how sentiment analysis can be enhanced through an online learning mechanism, where user feedback dynamically influences the sentiment analyzer's lexicon.

The code begins by importing the necessary module from NLTK and downloading the VADER lexicon, a sentiment analysis tool included in the NLTK library. The VADER lexicon is a pre-trained model capable of providing sentiment intensity scores for text, including a compound score that reflects the overall sentiment.

The main component of the code is the OnlineSentimentAnalysis class. The class initializes a SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from NLTK in its constructor, serving as the sentiment analysis engine. The class contains two essential methods: analyze_sentiment for predicting sentiment based on the compound score and online_learning for updating the sentiment analyzer's lexicon based on user feedback.

In the analyze_sentiment method, the compound score is calculated for the given text. Depending on whether the compound score is greater than or equal to 0.05, less than or equal to -0.05, or falls within the neutral range, the method categorizes the sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral, respectively.

The online_learning method is designed for the online learning mechanism. It takes user feedback and the current sentiment as parameters and updates the sentiment analyzer's lexicon accordingly. If the user provides positive feedback and the current sentiment is not already labeled as Positive, the lexicon is updated with a positive term ('good'). Similarly, if the user provides negative feedback and the current sentiment is not already labeled as Negative, the lexicon is updated with a negative term ('bad').

The example usage section demonstrates the Online Sentiment Analysis system in action. An instance of the OnlineSentimentAnalysis class is created, and a loop is initiated for online learning, simulating interactions with users. In each iteration, the user is prompted to input a sentence for sentiment analysis. The current sentiment is predicted using the analyze_sentiment method, displayed to the user, and feedback is collected. The online_learning method updates the lexicon based on the user's feedback.

After several iterations, the system prompts the user to input a new sentence for sentiment analysis. The sentiment for the new input is predicted using the updated model, reflecting the impact of the online learning process. The final predicted sentiment is then displayed.

In summary, this code showcases a simplified implementation of an Online Sentiment Analysis system with an online learning mechanism. It provides a foundation for understanding how user feedback can be incorporated dynamically to improve sentiment analysis predictions. For real-world applications, additional considerations such as model persistence, scalability, and user experience enhancements would be essential.
